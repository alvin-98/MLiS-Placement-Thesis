 Question: The cyclic subgroup of Z_24 generated by 18 has order
Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 12 (D) 6
Answer:"," (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 12 (D) 6

<think>
Okay, so I have this question about cyclic subgroups in Z_24. The question is asking for the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by 18. The choices are A) 4, B) 8, C) 12, D) 6. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that Z_24 is the group of integers modulo 24 under addition. So, it's a cyclic group of order 24. Now, when we talk about a cyclic subgroup generated by an element, say 'a', in Z_n, the order of that subgroup is given by the least common multiple of 'a' and 'n' divided by 'a'. Wait, no, that's not quite right. I think it's actually the order of the element 'a' in Z_n, which is n divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 'a' and 'n'. So, the formula should be order = n / gcd(a, n).

In this case, the element is 18, and n is 24. So, I need to compute gcd(18, 24). Let me think about the factors of 18 and 24. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The common factors are 1, 2, 3, 6. The greatest one is 6. So, gcd(18,24) is 6.

Now, using the formula, the order of the subgroup generated by 18 is 24 divided by 6, which is 4. So, the order is 4. Looking at the choices, A is 4, so the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that the cyclic subgroup generated by 18 in Z_24 will consist of multiples of 18 modulo 24. So, let's list them:

18*1 = 18 mod24

 Question: Find the order of the factor group Z_6/<3>.
Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 6 (D) 12
Answer:"," (A) because...

The factor group Z_6/<3> is formed by taking the quotient of Z_6 by the subgroup generated by 3. Since Z_6 is a cyclic group of order 6 and <3> is a subgroup of order 2, the order of the factor group is 6 divided by 2, which is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) because the order of Z_6 is 6, the order of <3> is 2, and 6 divided by 2 equals 3.

 Question: Statement 1 | A permutation that is a product of m even permutations and n odd permutations is an even permutation if and only if n is even. Statement 2 | Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
Choices: (A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True
Answer:"," 

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about permutations and group theory. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. I need to determine if each is true or false and then choose the correct option from A to D.

Starting with Statement 1: ""A permutation that is a product of m even permutations and n odd permutations is an even permutation if and only if n is even.""

Hmm, okay. So, permutations can be even or odd based on whether they can be expressed as an even or odd number of transpositions (swaps of two elements). The product of permutations' parity (evenness or oddness) depends on the number of odd permutations in the product. 

Wait, so if I have m even permutations and n odd permutations multiplied together, what's the overall parity? Each even permutation doesn't change the parity because multiplying by an even permutation doesn't affect the overall parity. Each odd permutation, on the other hand, flips the parity. So, if I have n odd permutations, the total number of parity flips is n. 

So, the total parity would be the product of all these. Since each even permutation contributes nothing to the parity, the key is the number of odd permutations. If n is even, then the total number of parity flips is even, so the overall permutation is even. If n is odd, then the overall permutation is odd.

So Statement 1 says that the permutation is even iff n is even. That seems correct. Because the number of odd permutations determines the overall parity. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: ""Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.""

Oh, that rings a bell. Isn't that Cayley's theorem? I think Cayley's theorem states that every group is isomorphic to a permutation group. So yes, every group can be represented as a group of permutations. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but let me make sure. Cayley's theorem says that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on its elements. So yes, that's correct. So Statement 2 is True.

So both statements are true. Looking at the choices, option A is (True, True), which would be the correct answer.

 Question: Find the order of the factor group (Z_4 x Z_12)/(<2> x <2>)
Choices: (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 12
Answer:"," (A) 2

The user's question is about group theory, specifically finding the order of a factor group. The group in question is (Z_4 x Z_12) modulo the subgroup generated by <2> x <2>. The choices are 2, 3, 4, or 12. The correct answer is (A) 2.

To solve this, I need to understand the structure of the original group and the subgroup. Z_4 is the cyclic group of order 4, and Z_12 is the cyclic group of order 12. The subgroup <2> in Z_4 is generated by the element 2, which has order 2 because 2 + 2 = 0 in Z_4. Similarly, in Z_12, <2> is generated by 2, which has order 6 because 2*6 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 12.

The subgroup <2> x <2> is then a subgroup of Z_4 x Z_12. To find the order of the factor group, I need to compute the order of the original group divided by the order of the subgroup. The order of Z_4 x Z_12 is 4 * 12 = 48. The order of <2> x <2> is 2 * 6 = 12. Therefore, the order of the factor group is 48 / 12 = 4. Wait, that contradicts the initial answer given. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the structure of the factor group more carefully. Maybe the factor group is not cyclic, and its order is actually the least common multiple of the orders of the individual factor groups. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the orders of the elements in the factor group to determine its structure.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the First Isomorphism Theorem or consider the orders of the generators. Let me think again. The original group is Z_4 x Z_12, which is abelian. The subgroup <2> x <2> is also abelian. The factor group will have order equal to the index of the subgroup in the original group, which is |G| / |H| = 48 / 12 = 4. But the initial answer was 2,",,C

 Question: Find the maximum possible order for some element of Z_4 x Z_6.
Choices: (A) 4 (B) 6 (C) 12 (D) 24
Answer:"," (A) 4 (B) 6 (C) 12 (D) 24

<think>
Okay, so I have this question about finding the maximum possible order for an element in the group Z_4 x Z_6. The options are 4, 6, 12, and 24. Hmm, I remember that the order of an element in a direct product of groups is related to the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its components in each group. Let me think through this step by step.

First, Z_4 is the cyclic group of integers modulo 4, and Z_6 is the cyclic group of integers modulo 6. So any element in Z_4 x Z_6 is a pair (a, b) where a is in Z_4 and b is in Z_6. The order of this element is the smallest positive integer n such that n*(a, b) = (0, 0) in Z_4 x Z_6. That means n*a ≡ 0 mod 4 and n*b ≡ 0 mod 6.

So the order of (a, b) is the LCM of the orders of a in Z_4 and b in Z_6. Let me recall that the order of an element in a cyclic group Z_n is equal to n divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the element and n. So for Z_4, the possible orders of elements are divisors of 4, which are 1, 2, and 4. Similarly, for Z_6, the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

To find the maximum possible order of an element in Z_4 x Z_6, I need to find the maximum LCM of the orders from Z_4 and Z_6. Let's list all possible combinations:

- Order in Z_4: 1, 2, 4
- Order in Z_6: 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, compute the LCM for each pair:

- LCM(1,1) = 1
- LCM(1,2) = 2
- LCM(1,3) = 3
- LCM(1,6) = 6
- LCM(2,1)",,C

 Question: Statement 1 | The symmetric group S_3 is cyclic. Statement 2 | Every group is isomorphic to some group of permutations.
Choices: (A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True
Answer:"," 

The answer is (D) because:

Statement 1: The symmetric group S_3 is cyclic. Let's analyze this. S_3 is the group of all permutations of three elements. It has 6 elements. A cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element. In S_3, the possible orders of elements are 1, 2, and 3. The maximum order of an element in S_3 is 3, which is achieved by a 3-cycle. However, since S_3 has 6 elements, if it were cyclic, it would need to have an element of order 6. But in S_3, the highest order is 3, so it cannot be cyclic. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2: Every group is isomorphic to some group of permutations. This is referring to Cayley's theorem, which states that every group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on G. Therefore, every group can indeed be represented as a group of permutations, making Statement 2 true.

So, Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, which corresponds to option D.
</think>

The answer is (D) because:

Statement 1: The symmetric group S₃ is not cyclic. S₃ has 6 elements, and its elements have orders 1, 2, or 3. Since there's no element of order 6, it can't be cyclic. Thus, Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2: By Cayley's theorem, every group is isomorphic to a permutation group. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.

 Question: Statement 1 | If a and b are elements of finite order in an Abelian group, then |ab| is the lcm (|a|,|b|). Statement 2 | If g is a group element and g^n = e, then |g| = n.
Choices: (A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True
Answer:"," 

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I need to figure out whether each statement is true or false. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts.

First, Statement 1 says: If a and b are elements of finite order in an Abelian group, then the order of ab is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of a and b. Hmm, I remember that in an Abelian group, the group operation is commutative, so ab = ba. I also recall that the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n is the identity element.

Now, I think that in an Abelian group, if a and b have orders m and n respectively, then the order of ab divides the lcm(m, n). But wait, does it always equal the lcm? I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose a has order 2 and b has order 3 in some Abelian group. Then ab should have order lcm(2,3) = 6. But wait, is that always the case?

Wait, no. What if a and b have some common factors in their orders? For instance, suppose a has order 4 and b has order 6 in an Abelian group. The lcm of 4 and 6 is 12. But if a and b commute, does ab necessarily have order 12? Or could it be less? Let me think of a specific example.

Take the group Z_4 × Z_6, which is Abelian. Let a = (1,0) which has order 4, and b = (0,1) which has order 6. Then ab = (1,1). What's the order of (1,1) in Z_4 × Z_6? The order is the least common multiple of the orders of 1 in Z_4 and 1 in Z_6. The order of 1 in Z_4 is 4, and in Z_6 it's 6. So the order of (1,1) is lcm(4,6) = 12. So in this case, it works.

But wait, what if a and b are not coprime in their orders? Let's say a has order 2 and b has order 2 in an Abelian group. Then ab would have order",,B

Answer:"," 

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically dealing with homomorphisms and normal subgroups. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. I need to evaluate each one to determine if they're true or false and then choose the correct option from A to D.

Starting with Statement 1: ""If f is a homomorphism from G to K and H is normal in G then f(H) is normal in K."" Hmm, I remember that homomorphisms preserve certain structures, but I'm not entirely sure about normality. Let me think. A normal subgroup H of G means that for every g in G, gHg^{-1} = H. Now, if f is a homomorphism, then f(gHg^{-1}) should be f(H)f(g)^{-1}f(g), right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, f(gHg^{-1}) would be f(g)f(H)f(g^{-1}), because homomorphisms map products to products. So that's f(g) f(H) f(g^{-1}).

But for f(H) to be normal in K, we need that for every k in K, k f(H) k^{-1} = f(H). Since K is the image of f, every k is f(g) for some g in G. So substituting, we get f(g) f(H) f(g)^{-1} = f(g H g^{-1}) because f is a homomorphism. But since H is normal in G, g H g^{-1} is still H, so f(g H g^{-1}) = f(H). Therefore, f(H) is normal in K. So Statement 1 seems to be true.

Wait, but is there any case where this might not hold? Maybe if f is not surjective? Because K is the codomain, not necessarily the image. But the normality doesn't depend on surjectivity, right? Because the condition is about conjugation by any element of K, which is the same as conjugation by f(g) for some g in G. So even if f isn't surjective, the argument still holds because we're only considering elements in K, which are images of G. So I think Statement 1 is true.

 Question: Find the maximum possible order for an element of S_n for n = 7.

Answer:"," (A) 6 (B) 12 (C) 30 (D) 105

<think>
Okay, so I have this question about finding the maximum possible order of an element in the symmetric group S₇. The options are 6, 12, 30, and 105. Hmm, I remember that the order of an element in a symmetric group is related to the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. So, for example, if an element is a product of cycles of lengths a, b, c, etc., then the order is LCM(a, b, c, ...).

Since we're dealing with S₇, the element can be written as a product of disjoint cycles whose lengths add up to 7. My task is to find the combination of cycle lengths that gives the highest possible LCM.

Let me list out all possible partitions of 7 and compute their LCMs. The partitions of 7 are:

1. 7: This is a single 7-cycle. The order is LCM(7) = 7.
2. 6 + 1: A 6-cycle and a fixed point. Order is LCM(6,1) = 6.
3. 5 + 2: A 5-cycle and a 2-cycle. Order is LCM(5,2) = 10.
4. 5 + 1 + 1: A 5-cycle and two fixed points. Order is LCM(5,1,1) = 5.

 Question: Statement 1 | Every integral domain has a field of quotients. Statement 2 | A polynomial of degree n over a ring can have at most n zeros counting multiplicity.
Choices: (A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True
Answer:"," 

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about abstract algebra, specifically dealing with integral domains and polynomials over rings. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: ""Every integral domain has a field of quotients."" I remember that an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. Now, a field of quotients, or more commonly called the field of fractions, is a field constructed from an integral domain such that every element can be expressed as a fraction of two elements from the domain. I think this is always possible for integral domains because there's a theorem that says every integral domain can be embedded in a field. So Statement 1 should be true.

Moving on to Statement 2: ""A polynomial of degree n over a ring can have at most n zeros counting multiplicity."" Wait, this rings a bell. I recall that in fields, a polynomial of degree n can have at most n roots, right? But here it's over a ring, not necessarily a field. Rings can have zero divisors, which might affect the number of roots a polynomial can have. For example, in the ring of integers modulo 6, which is a commutative ring with unity but not a field, consider the polynomial x^2 - 1. This factors as (x - 1)(x + 1), so it has roots at 1 and 5. But wait, that's only two roots, which is equal to the degree. Hmm, maybe that's not the best example.

Wait, another example: in the ring Z/4Z, consider the polynomial x^2. It has a root at x=0, but also at x=2 because 2^2 = 4 ≡ 0 mod 4. So x=0 is a root of multiplicity 2, but the polynomial x^2 has only one distinct root, but with multiplicity two. So in this case, the number of zeros counting multiplicity is equal to the degree, but the number of distinct zeros is less. But the statement says ""at most n zeros counting multiplicity."" Wait, but in this case, it's exactly n. So maybe in some rings, you can have more? Or is it that in some rings, you can have more roots?

Wait, no, actually,",,C
