      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to calculate the total parking charge for a Long Term Remote stand at West Aerodrome Parking (WAP), with no overnight parking and a variable parking duration in hours. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to identify all the values required from the document. The main factors here are the stand type (Long Term Remote), the parking duration, and whether there's overnight parking. The document mentions that overnight parking from 2300-0600 is free, but the user specified no overnight parking, so that part might not apply here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the West Aerodrome Parking table, the standard charge for Long Term Remote is 180.00 euros per day or part thereof. Wait, the charging basis is per 15 minutes except for Long Term Remote, which is per day. But the user's parking duration is given in hours. So I need to convert the duration into days. However, the problem states that the duration is a variable in hours, so maybe the calculation needs to handle that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the surcharges. The document says that for WAP, if parking is between 48-72 hours, the surcharge is standard rate, and over 72 hours, it's standard rate +200%. Wait, the table for WAP's surcharges says for 48-72 hours, it's standard rate (so no extra?), and 72+ is standard +200%. Wait, the description says \"Standard rate\" for 48-72, which might mean no surcharge? Or is the surcharge applied based on the duration? Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the WAP table: under surcharges, 48 hours up to 72 hours (including night-time) has a surcharge of \"Standard rate\", which might mean no additional charge. But 72 hours and over has \"Standard rate +200%\". Wait, that seems odd. Maybe the surcharge is applied as a percentage. So if the standard rate is 180 euros per day, then for 48-72 hours, it's just the standard rate, but for over 72 hours, it's 180 * 3 (since 200% more). But the user's parking duration is a variable, so we need to check if it's over 72 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user mentioned \"no overnight parking\", so the duration doesn't include the free overnight period. However, the surcharges are based on the total duration, regardless of overnight. So even if the parking is during the day, if it's over 72 hours, the surcharge applies.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Determine the standard charge per day for Long Term Remote at WAP: 180.00 euros.\n",
      "2. Calculate\n"

      "1. **Identify All Values From Document Required for Charge Calculation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The user is asking for the total parking charge for a Long Term Remote stand type at West Aerodrome Parking (WAP) with no overnight parking and a variable parking duration in hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the document, the relevant information is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Standard charge per aircraft/stand type for Long Term Remote at WAP**: €180.00 per day or part thereof.\n",
      "- **Parking surcharges for WAP**:\n",
      "  - 48 hours up to 72 hours (including night-time): Standard rate + 0% (i.e., standard rate)\n",
      "  - 72 hours and over (including night-time): Standard rate + 200%\n",
      "- **Overnight parking (2300-0600hrs) is free of charge**, but the user specified \"no overnight parking\", so this surcharge does not apply.\n",
      "- **Parking duration is a variable with unit hours**.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Identify Variables:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The variables needed for the calculation are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **parking_duration_hours**: The total duration of parking in hours.\n",
      "- **aircraft_stand_type**: \"Long Term Remote\" (specific to WAP).\n",
      "- **is_overnight_parking**: False (as per the user's request).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Synthesize Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The total parking charge depends on the parking duration:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If the duration is less than 48 hours, the charge is the standard rate of €180.00 per day or part thereof.\n",
      "- If the duration is between 48 and 72 hours (inclusive), the charge is the standard rate (€180.00) with no surcharge.\n",
      "- If the duration is more than 72 hours, the charge is the standard rate plus 200% surcharge (i.e., 3 × €180.00).\n",
      "\n",
      "The calculation must first determine how many full days (or part thereof) the parking duration spans, then apply the appropriate surcharge based on the duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rethink and Finalize Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is correct. The key is to calculate the number of days (or part thereof) based on the parking duration in hours, then apply the surcharge based on the duration range.\n",

      "1. **Identify All Values From Document Required for Charge Calculation:**\n",
      "   - The parking stand type is \"Long Term Remote\" at West Aerodrome Parking (WAP).\n",
      "   - The parking duration is a variable in hours.\n",
      "   - The parking duration is not during overnight hours (2300-0600hrs), so no free overnight charge applies.\n",
      "   - The standard charge for Long Term Remote at WAP is €180.00 per day or part thereof.\n",
      "   - Surcharges apply for parking durations of 48-72 hours (standard rate +100%) and 72+ hours (standard rate +200%).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Identify Variables:**\n",
      "   - **parking_duration_hours**: The total duration of parking in hours.\n",
      "   - **aircraft_stand_type**: \"Long Term Remote\" (though this is fixed in this case, it's still a variable in the formula).\n",
      "   - **is_overnight_parking**: False (since the query specifies no overnight parking).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Synthesize Plan:**\n",
      "   - The base charge is €180.00 per day or part thereof. Since the duration is in hours, we need to convert it to days (e.g., 25 hours = 2 days, 73 hours = 5 days).\n",
      "   - Determine if the duration falls into the 48-72 hour surcharge band or the 72+ hour surcharge band.\n",
      "   - Apply the appropriate surcharge percentage to the base charge.\n",
      "   - Sum the base charge and surcharge to get the total parking charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rethink and Finalize Approach:**\n",
      "   - The calculation needs to account for the duration in hours, convert it to days (rounded up), and apply surcharges based on the duration.\n",
      "   - The formula should first calculate the number of days (ceiling of hours / 24), then apply surcharge based on the duration in hours.\n",
      "   - The final expression tree should reflect this logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I will generate the JSON expression tree based on this reasoning.\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants the total parking charge for a Long Term Remote stand at West Aerodrome Parking (WAP) with no overnight parking. The parking duration is a variable in hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to check the document for the relevant charges. From section 3.2 on West Aerodrome Parking, the standard charge for Long Term Remote is €180.00 per day or part thereof. The surcharges are 100% for 48-72 hours and 200% for over 72 hours. But since the duration is in hours, I need to convert that to days. However, the surcharges are based on the actual hours, not days. So if the parking is \n"

      "   - The parking duration is a variable in hours.\n",
      "   - The parking duration is not during overnight hours (2300-0600hrs), so no free overnight charge applies.\n",
      "   - The standard charge for Long Term Remote at WAP is €180.00 per day or part thereof.\n",
      "   - Surcharges apply for parking durations of 48-72 hours (standard rate +100%) and 72+ hours (standard rate +200%).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Identify Variables:**\n",
      "   - **parking_duration_hours**: The total duration of parking in hours.\n",
      "   - **aircraft_stand_type**: \"Long Term Remote\" (though this is fixed in this case, it's still a variable in the formula).\n",
      "   - **is_overnight_parking**: False (since the query specifies no overnight parking).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Synthesize Plan:**\n",
      "   - The base charge is €180.00 per day or part thereof. Since the duration is in hours, we need to convert it to days (e.g., 25 hours = 2 days, 73 hours = 5 days).\n",
      "   - Determine if the duration falls into the 48-72 hour surcharge band or the 72+ hour surcharge band.\n",
      "   - Apply the appropriate surcharge percentage to the base charge.\n",
      "   - Sum the base charge and surcharge to get the total parking charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Rethink and Finalize Approach:**\n",
      "   - The calculation needs to account for the duration in hours, convert it to days (rounded up), and apply surcharges based on the duration.\n",
      "   - The formula should first calculate the number of days (ceiling of hours / 24), then apply surcharge based on the duration in hours.\n",
      "   - The final expression tree should reflect this logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I will generate the JSON expression tree based on this reasoning.\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants the total parking charge for a Long Term Remote stand at West Aerodrome Parking (WAP) with no overnight parking. The parking duration is a variable in hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to check the document for the relevant charges. From section 3.2 on West Aerodrome Parking, the standard charge for Long Term Remote is €180.00 per day or part thereof. The surcharges are 100% for 48-72 hours and 200% for over 72 hours. But since the duration is in hours, I need to convert that to days. However, the surcharges are based on the actual hours, not days. So if the parking is 48 hours, it's 100% surcharge, and 72 hours is 200%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the document says surcharges apply for 48-72 hours (including night-time) and 72+ hours. But the user specified no overnight parking, so the duration is during the day. But the surcharge is based on the duration, not the time of day. So even if it's not overnight, the surcharge applies if the duration meets the thresholds.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps are: calculate the base charge (€180 per day, rounded up to the next day if any part of a day is used), then check the duration in hours. If the duration is between 48 and 72 hours, add 100% surcharge. If over 72, add 200%. But wait, the surcharge is applied to the standard rate. So the base charge is per day, but the surcharge is based on the duration. Hmm, maybe the surcharge is applied to the total charge based on the duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the document says: \"Aircraft parking for extended periods in WAP attract the following surcharges: 48 hours up to 72 hours (including night-time) - Standard rate +100%, 72 hours and over - Standard rate +200%.\" So the surcharge is added to the standard rate. So if the parking duration is 48-72 hours, the total charge is standard rate * 2. If over 72, standard rate * 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the standard rate is per day. So the base charge is calculated as (ceil(duration_hours / 24)) * 180. Then, if the duration is >=48 and <72, multiply by 2. If >=72, multiply by 3. But wait, the surcharge is based\n"
