*See Appendix 2 for further details  

- A parking charge applies from the actual time of arrival (landed time) to the actual time of departure (airborne time) minus 30 minutes as recorded in the Dublin Airport Operations System (AOS) database.  

- On full implementation of Aerial View Display (AVD) at Dublin Airport, on/off block times of the aircraft, captured by AVD, will be used to apply parking charges to the full parking duration (per 15 minutes or part thereof) recorded.  

- An up-to-date list of stands is set out in the current Dublin Airport Stand Definition Table which is available on the Airport Charges page of the Dublin Airport website.  

- Stands are allocated in accordance with the current Dublin Airport Stand Allocation Rules & Priorities Document, which is available on the Airport Charges page of the Dublin Airport website.  

- Overnight parking from 2300-0600hrs local-time (night-time) is free of charge.  

- A Quick Return Flight (QRF) will incur parking charges payable at standard rates.  

- Search and rescue (duty operations) in addition to emergency services on behalf of the State are exempt from aircraft parking charges subject to there being a suitable location for parking and subject to operational clearance.  

- A designated light aircraft parking zone is identified and signposted at Dublin. Only aircraft parked within the designated parking zone will be entitled to avail of the reduced charge. A minimum charge of €3.20 will apply for light aircraft. Surcharges outlined in Table 1 apply for light aircraft parked in the designated parking zone and/or in any other EAP area.  

- Light aircraft parking in the West Apron North will be entitled to the Light Aircraft Parking charge. Depending on availability, the stands in this area will also be available to commercial aircraft which will pay the respective parking charge (i.e. narrow / wide body charges).  

- Parking surcharges are applicable to aircraft parked for an extended period at Dublin Airport. The level of the surcharge is dependent on the sector (EAP or WAP) in which the aircraft is parked and for the duration of the parking period in that location.  


# 3.5. Transfer Passenger Charge

\bullet Transfer Passenger information shall be provided via passenger transfer messages (PTM). Where valid information is provided in this manner the transfer rate will be charged to the Operator through the normal billing process. \bullet Airline positioning crews are not exempt from these charges.  

- A QRF will have its Transfer Passenger Charge exempted. This means that the QRF departing Transfer Passenger Charge will not be raised on the first departure. The subsequent second departure of that flight will attract the standard Transfer Passenger Charge.  

This Transfer Passenger Charge contributes to airport security, passenger screening and provision of infrastructure for hold baggage screening.  



# 3.8. Environmental Charges  

- Dublin Airport has allocated noise charging with an aeronautical charge apportioned to a corresponding QC value for 2025. The noise charge will be based on a set fee per Tonne and the proposed charging rates are outlined in the following table:  

<html>
<table><thead><tr><th colspan="3"><strong>Noise Charges</strong></th></tr><tr><th>QC</th><th>Set fee per Tonne 2025<br>Day</th><th>Set fee per Tonne 2025<br>Night</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td><span style="color: green;">€0.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€0.00</span></td></tr><tr><td>0.125</td><td><span style="color: green;">€0.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€0.00</span></td></tr><tr><td>0.25</td><td><span style="color: green;">€0.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€0.00</span></td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td><span style="color: green;">€0.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€2.00</span></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><span style="color: green;">€1.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€4.00</span></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><span style="color: green;">€2.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€8.00</span></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><span style="color: green;">€4.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€12.00</span></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><span style="color: green;">€6.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€16.00</span></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><span style="color: green;">€8.00</span></td><td><span style="color: green;">€20.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table>

- The application will be based on the QC system, with an aircraft's noise certification which takes account of both aircraft type and specific configurations such as engines and other noise reduction design features. This is to be submitted by the airline via the AFDF and audit checks will be undertaken to ensure the validity of submitted details.  

- The live application of noise charges commenced on 1st July 2022. The application of noise measurement under the QC system is managed using:  

Arrival movement

Noise Classification = Noise Approach (EPNdB) – 9dB  

# Departure movement  

Noise Classification = Average of Noise Lateral (EPNdB) and Noise Take-off (EPNdB)  

# Noise Charge Time  

Noise Charging fee/discount per set tonne for aircraft listed within from QC0-QC16 and above applies Day and Night. Day is defined by the hours between 0700 and 2259. Night is defined by the hours between 2300 and 0659. All times are local.  

- The Noise Classification values are then used to assign a Quota Count Value according to the following table:  

<html>
<table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">QC Assignments</th></tr><tr><th>Noise Classification lower bound</th><th>Noise Classification upper bound</th><th>Quota Count Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">$<$81</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">83.9</span></td><td>0.125</td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">86.7</span></td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>87</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">89.9</span></td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">92.9</span></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">95.9</span></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>96</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">98.9</span></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">101.9</span></td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">$>$101.9</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table>
