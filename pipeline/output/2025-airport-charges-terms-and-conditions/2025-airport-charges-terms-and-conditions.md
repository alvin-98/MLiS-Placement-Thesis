</html>  

- The application will be based on the QC system, with an aircraft's noise certification which takes account of both aircraft type and specific configurations such as engines and other noise reduction design features. This is to be submitted by the airline via the AFDF and audit checks will be undertaken to ensure the validity of submitted details.  

- The live application of noise charges commenced on 1st July 2022. The application of noise measurement under the QC system is managed using:  

Arrival movement

Noise Classification = Noise Approach (EPNdB) – 9dB  

# Departure movement  

Noise Classification = Average of Noise Lateral (EPNdB) and Noise Take-off (EPNdB)  

# Noise Charge Time  

Noise Charging fee/discount per set tonne for aircraft listed within from QC0-QC16 and above applies Day and Night. Day is defined by the hours between 0700 and 2259. Night is defined by the hours between 2300 and 0659. All times are local.  

- The Noise Classification values are then used to assign a Quota Count Value according to the following table:  

<html>
<table><thead><tr><th colspan="3">QC Assignments</th></tr><tr><th>Noise Classification lower bound</th><th>Noise Classification upper bound</th><th>Quota Count Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">$<$81</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">83.9</span></td><td>0.125</td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">86.7</span></td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>87</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">89.9</span></td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">92.9</span></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">95.9</span></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>96</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">98.9</span></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td><span style="background-color:yellow;">101.9</span></td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">$>$101.9</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table>

4.5 Subject to clause 4.14, where credit terms have been agreed, normal payment terms with daa will not exceed thirty days after invoice date. daa may apply different credit terms to any Operator. All credit arrangements are at the sole discretion of daa and may be amended at any time by daa and with immediate effect.  

4.6 The Operator must pay all Airport Charges (in respect of an aircraft) before the aircraft departs from the airport unless prior credit arrangements have been granted in writing by daa. Where credit terms have not been specifically agreed or where they have been exceeded or in circumstances where a previous default in respect of the payment of  

Airport Charges has not been remedied, cash/credit card settlement in respect of all Airport Charges due will be required before the aircraft departs from the airport.  

4.7 Operators who have not previously entered into credit arrangements with daa and who wish to be afforded credit facilities should make an application in writing to daa through the relevant credit information contact in the contact table outlined in section 6 of this document. daa may consult credit reference agencies in order to assess the creditworthiness of the Operator concerned. In addition, daa may seek audited accounts and other additional financial information including cash flow forecasts. In such circumstances, the Operator concerned may contact daa to determine the identity of the specific credit agencies involved.  

4.8	 Before providing credit facilities daa may seek any security that it deems appropriate and may amend its requirements for security from time to time at its sole discretion.  

4.9 An Operator (a "Lessor") shall notify daa at least 10 days in advance of any proposed arrangements by such Operator to lease (including sub-lease), licence or otherwise divest an interest (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes a wet lease) in one or more of its aircraft to another entity (a "Lessee").  

4.10 Without prejudice to daa's rights under clause 4.8, the Lessor and/or the Lessee shall provide to daa (i) such information, including financial details, relating to the Lessee as daa may require (ii) the name of the entity that is responsible for the management of an aircraft and (iii) such security in respect of any Airport Charges that may be payable by the Lessee as daa may require, including a guarantee by the Lessor of any obligations of the Lessee to daa. Notwithstanding any right of daa to recover Airport Charges from the Lessee and without prejudice to daa's rights under clause 4.3, if the Lessor fails to notify daa of any such arrangements the Lessor shall remain liable to daa for any Airport Charges not discharged by the Lessee. Any recovery of such amounts by the Lessor from the Lessee will be the sole responsibility of the Lessor.  

4.11 Payments due shall be made in full without deductions. Without the express written consent of daa, the Operator shall not be entitled to make any set off against or deduction from the charges invoiced, in respect of any claim that he/she may have against daa or otherwise.  

4.12 Where credit has been expressly granted the account must be settled within the specified credit period in respect of the goods and/or services provided, otherwise late payment interest and compensation may be charged in accordance with the provisions of European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) (S.I. No. 580 of 2012). In the event that an Operator wishes to query or dispute any of the transaction details set out on an invoice it is a requirement that any such query or dispute be made within 14 days of invoice date.

This should be submitted to AirsideStandardsAndPlanning@dublinairport.com. daa will consider the application in light of operational requirements that may prevail at the proposed parking period.  

A minimum charge of €1,800 will apply (10 days stay) regardless of the actual single transaction period of long-term parking. For example, should an aircraft apply and receive approval for long-term parking the aircraft operator will be billed €1,800 from the commencement date even if the aircraft departs before the end of the parking period sought. The aircraft is not permitted to return and re-commence its parking during that period except to facilitate minor maintenance works. Aircraft cannot be substituted during the stay period. Each aircraft will be considered as a separate long-term parking agreement.  

Please note that the long-term parking rate may not be available, in which case the published rates will apply.  

# Priorities – Allocation of stands for Long-term parking  

1) Operational Requirements 2) Aircraft availing of the Standby Aircraft Scheme 3) MRO aircraft 4) Other  

daa will endeavour to facilitate all requests for long-term parking but where demand exceeds supply daa will use the above criteria to prioritise usage.  

# Conditions of Use:  

# Operational:  

1. Generally, the maximum size of aircraft will be Code C with wingspan not exceeding 36m. Any exception to this must be approved by the Airside/Airport Duty Manager (ADM) and allocated by the daa stand allocation unit.

2. The long-term parking rate applies to the above category aircraft where a completed application form has been submitted and this has been approved by daa to park on designated parking stands for a minimum of 10 days.  

# General:  

1. The availability of the long-term parking rate and the level of availability of same will be determined solely by daa at its discretion 2. daa may have to terminate long-term parking on all/some designated stands should the operation require. daa will notify the aircraft operator by email and phone (using the details provided on application). 3. All operations must comply with all Aerodrome Notices. 4. The area will be monitored by the Airside Management Unit for compliance.  

5. Movements to and from the area shall be advised to the stand allocation unit who will record the movement and the parking position.

6. Aircraft arriving and departing on/off long-term parking are obliged to apply for a runway slot from ACL (Airports Co-ordination Ltd). Continuing support under this scheme is contingent on the operator cooperating fully with Dublin Airport's slot coordinator to assist in increasing operational efficiency at the airport.

7. The daa Stand Allocation Unit at daa Ext 44352/45228/45579 shall be advised of these movements.

8. If the ownership of the aircraft changes during the period that the aircraft is parked on the MRO Parking Station, the MRO must immediately notify the daa Stand Allocation Unit at daa Ext 44352/45228/45579 of the effective date of the change of ownership and the name of the new owner/operator.

9. Once approved for the Long-term parking rate, it will apply as long as an operator is fully compliant with the published Dublin Airport Terms and Conditions (available on the airport charges page located at www.dublinairport.com), and specifically with respect to:

a. The payment of invoices for all airport charges and any other fees and services provided by daa to the operator, including adhering to credit terms in respect of all daa invoices, unless daa, in its absolute discretion, shall otherwise determine.

b. The provision of information whereby the operator is required to provide daa with passenger, cargo and aircraft related information as outlined in the published Airport Charges at Dublin Airport Terms and Conditions, sections 4.14 to 4.33 inclusive.  

10. For the avoidance of doubt, any aircraft that is (i) not approved by daa as eligible for the long-term parking rate or (ii) not parked on the designated long-term parking stand shall be subject to published aircraft parking charges and surcharges.  

11. Specific operational rules may apply depending on the location of the long-term parking allocated. daa will advise of these specific conditions when approving a long-term parking application.
