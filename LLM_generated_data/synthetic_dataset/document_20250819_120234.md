## Managed Disk Fees
------------------

Managed Disk Pricing for Azure Virtual Machines and Managed Disks.

**Disk Storage Pricing**

The Disk Storage charge is applicable to the number of disks provisioned in a given subscription. This charge category is designed to provide a scalable and cost-effective solution for customers to store their data in the cloud.

The pricing model is tiered, with increasing charges for larger disk counts. Customers are charged according to the number of disks provisioned, with the following rates applying: 1 × num_disks for 0-10 disks, 2 × num_disks for 11-33 disks, 3 × num_disks for 34-36 disks, and 4 × num_disks for 37-63 disks.

## Data Egress Fees: Charges for Data Transferred Out of Microsoft Azure to External Networks and Services.

Geo Region Pricing Charge

This charge category applies to Microsoft Azure services consumed in specific geographic regions. The charge is based on the geographic location of the resource and is denoted by the geo_region variable.

The charge is calculated as follows: a charge of 1 is applied to resources in the UK South region, a charge of 2 is applied to resources in West Europe, a charge of 3 is applied to resources in West US 2, a charge of 4 is applied to resources in UK West, a charge of 5 is applied to resources in East US, and a charge of 6 is applied to resources in North Europe.
