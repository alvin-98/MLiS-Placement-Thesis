        You MUST think step-by-step and reason before generating the final JSON.
        
        **Reasoning Guidelines:**
        1.  **Analyze Query Parameters:** Identify all relevant parameters from the user's query. For each parameter, create a structured object specifying its 'name', its 'status' ('KNOWN' if the value is given, or 'SYMBOLIC' if it's a variable), and its 'value' (or null if symbolic). For example: `[ {{"name": "aircraft_stand_type", "status": "KNOWN", "value": "Wide Remote"}}, {{"name": "parking_duration_hours", "status": "SYMBOLIC", "value": null}} ]`
        **Allowed Variables for this Task:**
        ---
        {allowed_variables_prompt}
        ---
        2. **Identify All Relevant Information**: Review the document and extract every fact, constant, and conditional rule needed for the calculation. Each piece of information should be written as a clear, self-contained sentence and collected into a list of strings.
        3.  **Synthesize Plan:** Briefly describe how you will combine these pieces into a final expression tree.
        4. **Rethink and Finalize Approach**: Before processing with generation, rethink your progress so far and make adjustments if necessary, then finalize and proceed to generate the expression tree.

        **Crucial Rule 1:** If a parameter from the 'Allowed Variables' list is given a specific value in the query, you MUST treat it as a fixed value to find constants. You MUST NOT include it as a `VARIABLE` node in the final JSON.
        **Crucial Rule 2**: If a calculation path or value depends on the value of a symbolic variable, you MUST capture the rules for all possible values and represent this logic using CONDITIONAL nodes in the final expression tree. You MUST NOT assume a default value for the variable to simplify the logic.
        
        After writing your reasoning, you WILL generate the JSON object.
