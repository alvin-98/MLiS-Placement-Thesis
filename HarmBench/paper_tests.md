## Harm bench experiments

- temperature decoding: does harmfulness probability increase with increasing temp, does variation in harmfulness of a prompt increase with different prompt (how do i calculate this? standadard deviation on harmfulness of a given prompt? take average across temperatures plot for change in temp)
- implement one of above attack methods to reproduce results in harm bench
